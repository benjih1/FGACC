						<h4>Friday 24th July: Email Update</h4>

						<blockquote>
							Hello everyone, <br>

Hope you are all keeping well. This is just an email to provide more details on the first club ride. <br>

The ride will be on <strong>Saturday 1st August starting at 9am. </strong> We will be riding from Otley - starting at Wharfedale Hospital.  <br>If you will be driving to the start of the ride - I have secured permission from the head of security at Leeds Hospitals for members to park free of charge - so just park in the hospital public car park. <br>

We will have at least two groups with different routes, depending on how many people are able to make it on the day. Group sizes will be tailored so people can keep an appropriate distance in line with COVID-19 guidance. <br>	

<strong>Shorter Route. </strong> <br>
For those newer to cycling, and if you’re worried about your fitness, there will be a shorter route, at a nice relaxed pace. It will go from Otley to Ilkley on the quiet country roads via Askwith. We will grab a coffee at the Commute Cafe and then follow the same route back. It is approx 7 miles each way so a 14 mile round trip. There are a few small hills on the route, but no mammoth climbs - so will be suited for all abilities. Please do not fear of being left behind - the group will ride at an appropriate pace for everyone, no matter your fitness level, or what type of bike you are using. The back roads are also reasonably traffic free so are good for newer riders. <br>

<strong>Longer Route.</strong><br>
This will follow the same route out of Otley towards Ilkley. From there, the route will again depend on the numbers who show up on the day. We may well do a medium length route, and a longer route - depending on peoples experience levels. But the route will likely extend beyond Ilkley towards Bolton Abbey and then loop back. We will also call off for coffee at the Commute Cafe to meet up with the other groups. <br>

<Strong>Group Riding.</Strong><br>
Rides will be fairly laid back and social - but it is useful for everyone to be aware of a few basic guidelines when riding in a group. <br>Please take a few minutes to read the following <a href="https://otleycycleclub.co.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Guide-to-group-riding.pdf"> guide</a> from Otley Cycling Club.
<br>
Its also useful to get in the habit of doing a few basic mechanical checks before you ride, to make sure your bike is safe to ride. This is a useful article outlining a <a href="https://www.bikeradar.com/news/five-things-you-should-check-before-every-ride/ ">few checks.</a>
<br>
<strong>Future Rides. </strong><br>
We are yet to decide further dates for rides as of yet, but will let you know as soon as we can. We will be starting rides in various locations around the region. <br> I am working on a section of the website for future rides, and hope to upload routes there too. If you have any suggestions of starting locations and routes - please get in touch. <br>

Additionally - if you want to arrange rides with other people in the club on other days - please join the Facebook Group and post on there. You can find the page <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/259671982003010 ">here.</a>
<br>
<strong>Mountain Bike Rides.</strong> <br>
A few people have enquired about mountain bike rides. I think a social ride at Leeds Urban Bike Park would be a useful starting point for this. If those interested in MTB drop me an email with some dates you are free, I will get this planned. If you don’t have a mountain bike but fancy trying it out - Leeds Urban Bike Park do hire bikes, as do a lot of mountain bike centres. So get in touch if you are new to mountain biking and fancy giving it a try. 
<br> <br>
I look forward to seeing some of you on the 1st August.

						<h4>Thursday 2nd July: Email Update</h4>

						<blockquote>
							Hi everyone, <br>

Hope you are all well. The weather is pretty shoddy at the moment but hopefully it will brighten up soon so we can all ride in better conditions! 
Just a few updates today. <br>

<strong>Jersey Orders.</strong>
Thanks to those that have ordered jerseys so far. I will leave it for a few more days until everyone has had a chance to place an order, then will submit the batch order to Paria. If you haven’t had chance to check them out yet - head to <a href=" https://alinecc.netlify.app/clubkit">the kit page.</a><br>
Thank you to everyone who has kindly contributed towards the design costs - that is much appreciated. <br>

<strong>Group Rides. </strong>
On the 1st August, my shielding ends so I figure what better way to celebrate than to organise the first ALCC ride on that day! So get Saturday 1st August marked in your diaries for the first ride. Meeting location and routes are yet to be decided but I will post updates nearer the time. 
To help with deciding this, could I kindly ask everyone to fill in a short survey. As I have said before, I want the club to be all inclusive, despite fitness/ability/experience. So it would be helpful in terms of planning to be able to know about this. Head to <a href=" https://forms.gle/Ta34DhCf45t1uath7">Google Forms</a> to fill out the survey. I would be really grateful if as many of you as possible could fill in this form. <br>

<strong>Discounts.</strong>
As mentioned in my last email, we have secured discount at the Commute Cycle Cafe in Ilkley - which has now been confirmed at 10%. This will be a regular stop on club rides, but if you just mention to the guys in there that you are a ALCC member, they will sort you out for 10% off. 
OTE sports nutrition are still sorting out codes for us - but we will be able to get 25% off for club members. <br>

<strong>Committee.</strong>
I am planning on setting up some form of committee to help with running the club. A couple of people have already expressed an interest in helping out with this, but if you haven’t, and would like to help out with the admin/organisational side of things - drop me an email. <br>
						</blockquote>

						<h4>Monday 29th June: Email Update</h4>
						<blockquote>
							Hello everyone, <br>

Firstly, welcome to all the new members who have joined over the weekend. We now have 50 members in total - which considering the club is only two weeks old, is great. <br>

So the main news - the jerseys are here! After working with the designers at Paria, this is what we have come up with - and I am really pleased with it. A subtle nod to the NHS with the colour scheme, but with a unique and eye catching design. <br>

For full details of the jerseys please go to the website - <a href=" https://alinecc.netlify.app/clubkit" >here</a> - where you will find details on price as well as size charts. At the bottom of the webpage is an order form for you to fill in, should you wish to order a jersey. Once all orders are in, I will contact you about how to pay. <br>

As mentioned in previous emails, there were initial design and setup costs. If you wish to contribute towards these, please follow this <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=XLWS5Q4MVZAJ6&currency_code=GBP&source=url">link.</a> <br>
If contributions exceed the costs, all funds will go into the club. If there is interest, I could use the funds towards designing other items of kit such as caps etc. <br>

If you have any questions about the jersey, or any other club related questions - fire me an email.

						<h4>Tuesday 23rd June: Email Update</h4>
						<blockquote>
							Hello all, <br>

Just a quick message with some small updates. Firstly, welcome to any new members that have joined since the last email was sent out. If you want to view previous emails sent out - check out the <a href="https://alinecc.netlify.app/news.html ">'News'</a> section of the website. <br>

So a few updates: <br>
<ul>
<li>We are up to 25 members now, which is fantastic. Posters are being put up around some hospitals now, and hopefully word will continue to spread. You can download the poster to print from the new section of the website. </li>

	<li>We now have a  <a href=" https://www.strava.com/clubs/alinecc">Strava club</a> - make sure you join. 

		<li>Jersey design is well underway. I have seen the first draft design, and its looking great. Once we have settled on a final design, I will put a picture up on the website. </li>

			<li>We have a new logo - this is now on the website and the various social media platforms. It will also feature on the jerseys. PLEASE COULD YOU REPLY AND LET ME KNOW IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN PURCHASING A JERSEY, SO I CAN GET AN IDEA OF NUMBERS TO BE ORDERED. </li>

				<li>If you wish to make a voluntary contribution towards the design costs - go to the about section of the website - and click on the ‘contribute’ button. This should take you to Paypal where you can make a payment. This is 100% secure, and all the contribution will go towards paying the designer. As I said, this is purely voluntary so please don’t feel any pressure to do this. Any issues with the payment, let me know. Alternatively, follow <a href=" https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=XLWS5Q4MVZAJ6&currency_code=GBP&source=url">this link</a> </li>

					<li>I have secured a 25% discount with the sports nutrition brand OTE Sports for club members. This has just been setup, so the finer details are yet to be worked out. But I should be able to provide you all with a code for this in the near future. They make great products and have won many awards. Many pro athletes and teams are sponsored by them including Yorkshires very own Brownlee Brothers. Check them out <a href=" https://www.otesports.co.uk">here.</a> </li>

						<li>I will be creating Facebook page and Whatsapp group for organising group rides. I will eventually publish a section on the website about group rides, including women's rides. This is a work in progress, so bear with me! If you’re not already - be sure to follow us on Twitter, Instagram. </li>

							<li>Eventually, we will hopefully be able to organise some mountain bike rides - as a few people have expressed interest in this, and I’m an MTB lover! We will also look to do some Zwift rides in the future, especially as we head into winter. </li>

								<li>At some point, I will create some form of committee to help with club organisation. Please let me know if you would be interested. </li> </ul>

Thats it for now. I really hope this club can continue to grow, and we can get some great events organised. Thanks to all of those that have shown enthusiasm so far! Give me a shout if you have any questions, or want to give me any feedback/suggestions.

						<h4>Mon 22nd June: New Logo (and jersey news)</h4>
						<blockquote>We have a new logo! Credit goes to Ben Lalabekyan <a href="https://twitter.com/anaecritmed" target="_"> (@anaecritmed) </a> for the design. I think it looks fantastic. This will feature on the website and social media profiles, as well as on the jerseys. On that note, I have seen the very early designs of the jerseys today, and they are looking amazing. I will share the updated designs with you later this week. </blockquote>

						<h4>Sun 21st June: Poster</h4>
                        <blockquote>I have made a poster for you to put up around your departments. In case you print it on NHS printers, I have kept it black and white! Click <a href="poster.pdf" target="_">here</a> to download the poster.</blockquote>

                        <h4>Fri 19th June: Email Update</h4>
                        <blockquote>
                            Hello everyone, <br> 


First of all - thank you to everyone who has registered and expressed your interest so far. I wasn’t quite sure how much interest there would be, so I’m chuffed that people are keen to get this club going. After the pretty mental first half of 2020, it will be great to have a new way for us to ride together and socialise (from a distance of course). 

I thought I would send you an email to update you on the progress so far, and the plans for the future. So far we have had around 20 people register in the last three days. I am hoping this will continue to grow as word spreads further. <br>

Initially, I think the focus will be to organise the club within West Yorkshire seen as that is where I am based, and so far, at least, where a majority of the members are. 
But very soon, I hope to have at least one person in each Yorkshire region to represent the club, and help organise local rides. If you are interested being a regional contact for the club, please let me know. In the future, organising larger rides in each region would be great. 
I am currently shielding, so am not on the road myself at the moment, but hope to be ASAP. British Cycling have a great set of guidelines about group rides, so as we are able to start organising them, I will be consulting those. <br>

I want to make the club all-inclusive, so riders of all abilities can join in. So once group rides begin, there will be a variety of paced groups. In addition, I think it is vitally important to give representation for female riders. Sarah Marsden, an anaesthetic registrar in the west has kindly volunteered to run the womens' cycling side of the club, and in the next few weeks, I am sure she will be in touch. If you are keen on helping Sarah with this, let me know and I will put you in touch. 

I have spoken earlier in the week with a Leeds based cycle clothing company - ‘Paria’ - who supply kit to a lot of Yorkshire based clubs and teams. They are working on designs over the next few days, and I hope I will be able to get the initial designs out to you some time next week. They are going to be giving us a pretty great discount so prices should be reasonable. There is an initial design cost which I am going to pay myself, but if you would like to make a small, voluntary contribution towards this, that would be very much appreciated. They charge £28/hr for design and estimate it will take approx 5 hour for initial design and modifications. Please get in touch if you would like to help with this. 

I am in contact with other local companies regarding sponsorship and affiliations with the club which I will update you on in the future. 

A few other last points - I am speaking to other trainees in other parts of the country to maybe replicate 

So that is it for the first email - apologies if its a bit lengthy!


If I could ask for the following from you: <br>

<ul>
<li>Let me know if you are interested in purchasing a jersey so I can get an idea of numbers for ordering. </li>
<li>Please contact me if you wish to contribute towards the initial design costs for the jerseys. </li>
<li>Contact me if you are interested in being a regional contact in East, South or North Yorkshire. </li>
<li>Continue to spread the word around your hospitals and local regions!</li>
<li>If you have any tips/feedback/recommendations about the club, please let me know. This is my first time starting a cycling club so its a learning curve. </li>
<li>Make sure you are following us on social media platforms - @A_Line_CC on Twitter, @alinecyclingclub on Instagram. </li>
<li>Join the  <a href ="https://www.strava.com/clubs/alinecc" target="_">Strava Club </a> if you are on Strava. </li> 
</ul> <br>

Many thanks, 

Ben Harris <br>
Founder, A-Line Cycling Club
