						<h4>Mon 22nd June: New Logo (and jersey news)</h4>
						<blockquote>We have a new logo! Credit goes to Ben Lalabekyan <a href="https://twitter.com/anaecritmed" target="_"> (@anaecritmed) </a> for the design. I think it looks fantastic. This will feature on the website and social media profiles, as well as on the jerseys. On that note, I have seen the very early designs of the jerseys today, and they are looking amazing. I will share the updated designs with you later this week. </blockquote> 
                        <h4>Sun 21st June: Poster</h4>
                        <blockquote>I have made a poster for you to put up around your departments. In case you print it on NHS printers, I have kept it black and white! Click <a href="poster.pdf" target="_">here</a> to download the poster.</blockquote>
						
                        <h4>Fri 19th June: Email Update</h4>
                        <blockquote>
                            Hello everyone, <br> 


First of all - thank you to everyone who has registered and expressed your interest so far. I wasn’t quite sure how much interest there would be, so I’m chuffed that people are keen to get this club going. After the pretty mental first half of 2020, it will be great to have a new way for us to ride together and socialise (from a distance of course). 

I thought I would send you an email to update you on the progress so far, and the plans for the future. So far we have had around 20 people register in the last three days. I am hoping this will continue to grow as word spreads further. <br>

Initially, I think the focus will be to organise the club within West Yorkshire seen as that is where I am based, and so far, at least, where a majority of the members are. 
But very soon, I hope to have at least one person in each Yorkshire region to represent the club, and help organise local rides. If you are interested being a regional contact for the club, please let me know. In the future, organising larger rides in each region would be great. 
I am currently shielding, so am not on the road myself at the moment, but hope to be ASAP. British Cycling have a great set of guidelines about group rides, so as we are able to start organising them, I will be consulting those. <br>

I want to make the club all-inclusive, so riders of all abilities can join in. So once group rides begin, there will be a variety of paced groups. In addition, I think it is vitally important to give representation for female riders. Sarah Marsden, an anaesthetic registrar in the west has kindly volunteered to run the womens' cycling side of the club, and in the next few weeks, I am sure she will be in touch. If you are keen on helping Sarah with this, let me know and I will put you in touch. 

I have spoken earlier in the week with a Leeds based cycle clothing company - ‘Paria’ - who supply kit to a lot of Yorkshire based clubs and teams. They are working on designs over the next few days, and I hope I will be able to get the initial designs out to you some time next week. They are going to be giving us a pretty great discount so prices should be reasonable. There is an initial design cost which I am going to pay myself, but if you would like to make a small, voluntary contribution towards this, that would be very much appreciated. They charge £28/hr for design and estimate it will take approx 5 hour for initial design and modifications. Please get in touch if you would like to help with this. 

I am in contact with other local companies regarding sponsorship and affiliations with the club which I will update you on in the future. 

A few other last points - I am speaking to other trainees in other parts of the country to maybe replicate 

So that is it for the first email - apologies if its a bit lengthy!


If I could ask for the following from you: <br>

<ul>
<li>Let me know if you are interested in purchasing a jersey so I can get an idea of numbers for ordering. </li>
<li>Please contact me if you wish to contribute towards the initial design costs for the jerseys. </li>
<li>Contact me if you are interested in being a regional contact in East, South or North Yorkshire. </li>
<li>Continue to spread the word around your hospitals and local regions!</li>
<li>If you have any tips/feedback/recommendations about the club, please let me know. This is my first time starting a cycling club so its a learning curve. </li>
<li>Make sure you are following us on social media platforms - @A_Line_CC on Twitter, @alinecyclingclub on Instagram. </li>
<li>Join the  <a href ="https://www.strava.com/clubs/alinecc" target="_">Strava Club </a> if you are on Strava. </li> 
</ul> <br>

Many thanks, 

Ben Harris <br>
Founder, A-Line Cycling Club
